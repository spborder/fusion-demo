This is an example deployment of a *fusion-tools* dashboard using [fly.io] (https://fly.io/).

The included Dockerfile includes steps for installing a specific version of *fusion-tools*.

Note: This resource allocation works and is inexpensive but is very slow. For actual deployments consider upgrading the machines.
